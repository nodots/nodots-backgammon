# Handoff Notes - August 2, 2025

## Summary of Work Completed

### Logging Optimization (✅ COMPLETED)
- **Enhanced client-side logger** in `/packages/client/src/utils/logger.ts`
- **Reduced log noise** by filtering large objects (>500 chars) to summary format
- **Replaced 35+ verbose console.log statements** in `useRobotTurnController.ts` with efficient logging
- **Added environment-based log control** via `VITE_LOG_LEVEL=info` in `.env`
- **Result**: Significantly reduced client-side logging overhead while maintaining debugging capability

### Undo Feature Bug Fix (⚠️ PARTIALLY WORKING)
- **Root cause identified**: `Game.undoLastMove()` wasn't resetting dice states when transitioning back to 'rolling'
- **Fixed core logic** in `/packages/core/src/Game/index.ts` using switch statement pattern
- **Fixed related tests** in `/packages/core/src/Game/__tests__/undo-move.test.ts`
- **Current status**: Undo logic works correctly in core package, but still experiencing issues in client

## Current Package Status

### packages/core ✅ STABLE
- **Game logic**: All core game mechanics working correctly
- **Undo functionality**: Fixed at the core level with proper state transitions
- **Tests**: All undo tests passing
- **Type system**: Strict TypeScript types preventing common errors
- **Key files**:
  - `/src/Game/index.ts` - Main game state management
  - `/src/Dice/index.ts` - Dice state handling
  - Tests all passing

### packages/client ⚠️ MOSTLY WORKING
- **Game UI**: Working correctly for normal gameplay
- **WebSocket connection**: Stable connection to `http://localhost:3000`
- **Logging**: Optimized and efficient
- **Known issues**:
  - Undo button still not working correctly (client-side integration issue)
  - WebSocket callback duplication resolved but monitoring needed
- **Key files**:
  - `/src/utils/logger.ts` - Enhanced logging utility
  - `/src/hooks/useRobotTurnController.ts` - Cleaned up logging
  - `/src/hooks/useWebSocketGameActions.ts` - WebSocket integration

### packages/api ✅ STABLE
- **REST endpoints**: All game operations working
- **WebSocket server**: Running on port 3000, handling real-time updates
- **Game state management**: Proper state transitions
- **No changes made**: API layer remained stable throughout work

### packages/types ✅ STABLE
- **Type definitions**: Comprehensive and strict
- **Game state types**: Properly modeling all game states
- **No changes needed**: Types were sufficient for all work

### packages/ai ✅ STABLE
- **Robot players**: Working correctly
- **Move generation**: Functioning properly
- **No issues identified**: AI logic working as expected

### packages/api-utils ✅ STABLE
- **Utility functions**: Working correctly
- **No changes needed**: Support functions stable

## Outstanding Issues

### 1. Undo Feature Client Integration (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Problem**: Undo works in core tests but fails in client UI
- **Investigation needed**: 
  - Check undo button event handlers in client
  - Verify WebSocket undo message handling
  - Ensure proper game state updates after undo
- **Files to check**:
  - Client undo button components
  - WebSocket undo action handling
  - Game state dispatch after undo operations

### 2. WebSocket Message Duplication (MONITORING)
- **Status**: Fixed callback registration duplication
- **Monitor**: Watch for return of 31+ duplicate callbacks
- **Files involved**:
  - `/packages/client/src/hooks/useWebSocketGameActions.ts`
  - `/packages/client/src/utils/websocketClient.ts`

## Development Environment

### Working URLs
- **Client**: `https://localhost:5437`
- **API**: `http://localhost:3000/api/v3.6`  
- **WebSocket**: `http://localhost:3000` (NOT 3443)

### Environment Configuration
- `/packages/client/.env` correctly configured
- `VITE_LOG_LEVEL=info` for optimal logging
- WebSocket URL hardcoded to correct port in client code

## Testing Status

### Core Package Tests ✅
- All undo tests passing
- Game state transition tests working
- Type validation tests working

### Client Package Tests ❓
- **Needs verification**: E2E tests for undo functionality
- **Needs verification**: WebSocket integration tests
- **Recommendation**: Run full test suite to verify current state

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. **Debug client-side undo integration**
   - Trace undo button click through to WebSocket message
   - Verify server response handling
   - Check game state update after undo

2. **Verify test coverage**
   - Run full test suite across all packages
   - Add E2E test for undo functionality if missing

### Short Term (Medium Priority)
1. **Monitor WebSocket stability**
   - Watch for callback duplication returning
   - Monitor connection stability under load

2. **Performance optimization**
   - Verify logging changes improved performance
   - Monitor memory usage with reduced logging

### Long Term (Low Priority)
1. **Code cleanup**
   - Remove temporary hardcoded WebSocket URL when env vars are fixed
   - Implement proper WebSocket callback cleanup methods

## Code Quality Notes

- **Functional Programming**: All new code follows FP patterns with switch statements
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript usage maintained
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling with Result types
- **Logging**: Clean, professional logging without emojis (except where existing)

## Files Modified in This Session

### Core Package
- `/src/Game/index.ts` - Fixed undo state transitions
- `/src/Game/__tests__/undo-move.test.ts` - Updated test expectations

### Client Package  
- `/src/utils/logger.ts` - Enhanced with data filtering
- `/src/hooks/useRobotTurnController.ts` - Replaced verbose logging
- `.env` - Added log level configuration

### Temporary Changes (Reverted)
- Vite config URL handling (reverted due to breaking changes)
- WebSocket client URL handling (reverted to maintain stability)

---

**Status**: Ready for continued development. Core undo logic is solid, client integration needs debugging.

**Priority**: Focus on client-side undo button integration as the core logic is working correctly.
