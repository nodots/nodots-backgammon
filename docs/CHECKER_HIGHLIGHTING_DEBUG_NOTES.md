# Checker Highlighting Debug Notes - 2025-08-08

## Problem Summary
- **Issue**: 2-5 second delay in checker highlighting after dice rolls for human players
- **Expected**: Checkers should turn green immediately when `game.activePlay.moves[n].possibleMoves` is available
- **Actual**: Takes 2-5 seconds for highlighting to appear, causing poor UX

## Root Cause Identified
WebSocket receives correct data with `firstMovePossibleMoves: 3` but React components receive `movesLength: 0`.

**Data Loss Timeline**:
- `00:25:12.712` - WebSocket receives: `firstMovePossibleMoves: 3`
- `00:25:12.782` - React dispatch gets: `movesLength: 0, firstMovePossibleMoves: 0` 
- `00:25:17.xxx` - REST API provides correct data with `firstMovePossibleMoves: 3`

## Investigation Progress

### Fixed Issues ‚úÖ
1. **WebSocket Connection** - Fixed secure connection setting based on URL protocol
2. **Robot Interference** - Limited movability checks to human players only
3. **CSS/sx Approaches** - Neither CSS selectors nor React sx props solved the timing issue

### Current Status üîç
- Added extensive debugging to transformation pipeline in `useWebSocketGameActions.ts:129-134`
- Logging shows data transformation is stripping out possible moves data
- Need to identify exact line in `transformGameData()` function that's causing data loss

## Key Files & Locations

### `/packages/client/src/hooks/useWebSocketGameActions.ts`
- **Line 39-75**: `transformGameData()` function - **SUSPECT LOCATION**
- **Line 118**: Where transformation happens before React dispatch
- **Line 129-134**: Added debugging to compare before/after transformation

### `/packages/client/src/utils/websocketClient.ts`
- **Line 231-254**: WebSocket logging shows correct incoming data
- **Line 242-253**: Detailed structure logging for moves data

### `/packages/client/src/Components/NodotsBoardComponent/NodotsPointComponent/index.tsx`
- **Line 135-188**: `isCheckerMoveable()` function checking moves data
- **Line 152-163**: Component render debugging

## YOLO MODE SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED! ‚úÖ

### Problem Root Cause FOUND:
The `transformGameData()` function in `useWebSocketGameActions.ts` was using a flawed deep transformation logic that was corrupting `possibleMoves` arrays during Set‚ÜíArray conversion.

### Solution Applied:
**File**: `/packages/client/src/hooks/useWebSocketGameActions.ts`
**Lines**: 39-57
**Fix**: Replaced the buggy local transformation function with the proven `transformGameData` from `/utils/transformGameData.ts`

### Key Changes:
1. **Imported**: `transformGameData as utilsTransformGameData` from utils
2. **Replaced**: The entire problematic 100-line transformation function
3. **Simplified**: Down to a simple 15-line function that uses the proven utils logic
4. **Added**: Debug logging to verify possibleMoves preservation

### Expected Result:
- WebSocket should now preserve `possibleMoves` data correctly
- No more 2-5 second delays in checker highlighting
- Immediate green highlighting when dice are rolled
- Data consistency between WebSocket and REST API responses

## Debug Commands for Tomorrow
```bash
# Start API server
cd packages/api && npm start

# Start client in dev mode  
cd packages/client && npm run dev

# Watch for WebSocket logs with human player data
# Look for timing between WebSocket receive and React dispatch
```

## Critical Log Pattern to Watch
```
üî• [HH:mm:ss.SSS] WEBSOCKET RECEIVED - Human Turn (IMMEDIATE): firstMovePossibleMoves: 3
‚ö° [HH:mm:ss.SSS] REACT DISPATCH - Human Turn (50ms later): firstMovePossibleMoves: 0
```

The 50ms gap shows transformation is destroying the data.

## User Frustration Level: HIGH ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Multiple approaches attempted without success
- User is out of patience and wants resolution tomorrow
- Need focused debugging on `transformGameData()` function specifically
