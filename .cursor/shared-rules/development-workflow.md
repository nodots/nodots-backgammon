# Development Workflow and Communication

## Branch Naming Standards

### Primary Branch

- **REQUIRED**: Use `main` as the primary branch name in ALL repositories
- **NEVER use**: `master` - this is deprecated and should be migrated to `main`
- **Branch protection**: Apply branch protection rules to `main` branch
- **Default branch**: Set `main` as the default branch in all repository settings

### Feature Branches

- Create feature branches from `main`
- Use descriptive branch names: `feature/description` or `fix/issue-description`
- Keep branch names concise but clear about the purpose

## Communication Standards

### Code Comments

- Write comments for business logic and game rules
- Avoid redundant comments that restate obvious code
- Use clear, concise language
- No adverbs or adjectives in comments - keep language direct and factual

### Commit Messages

- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Keep first line under 72 characters
- Include body for complex changes

### Pull Request Process

- Create feature branches from `main`
- Write descriptive PR titles and descriptions
- Include test coverage for new features
- Link to relevant issues
- Request review from at least one other developer
- Merge back to `main` after approval

### Code Review Standards

- Review for correctness, clarity, and consistency
- Check test coverage and edge cases
- Verify documentation updates
- Ensure backward compatibility

## Development Environment

### Required Tools

- Node.js 18+ with npm
- Git for version control
- Your preferred IDE with TypeScript support
- Access to shared development database

### Setup Process

1. Clone repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Copy environment template: `cp .env.example .env`
4. Configure environment variables
5. Run `npm test` to verify setup

### Git Workflow

- Use feature branches: `feature/description`
- Always branch from `main` (not master)
- Rebase before merging to maintain clean history
- Squash related commits when merging
- Tag releases with semantic versioning
- Keep `main` branch stable and deployable

## Testing Strategy

### Test Types

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure response times meet requirements

### Test Coverage

- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
- Cover all public API endpoints
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Include regression tests for bug fixes

### Test Organization

- Place tests in `__tests__` directories
- Use descriptive test names
- Group related tests with `describe` blocks
- Use `beforeEach` and `afterEach` for setup/teardown

## Error Handling

### Error Types

- **ValidationError**: Invalid input data
- **NotFoundError**: Resource not found
- **AuthenticationError**: Authentication failed
- **AuthorizationError**: Insufficient permissions
- **NetworkError**: Network connectivity issues

### Error Responses

- Include error code and message
- Provide actionable feedback to users
- Log errors with sufficient context
- Never expose sensitive information

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Document all public APIs
- Include usage examples
- Explain complex algorithms
- Keep documentation up to date

### API Documentation

- Use OpenAPI/Swagger specification
- Include request/response examples
- Document authentication requirements
- Explain error responses

### Architecture Documentation

- Document system design decisions
- Explain data flow and dependencies
- Include deployment instructions
- Maintain troubleshooting guides

## Security Practices

### Authentication

- Use secure authentication tokens
- Implement proper session management
- Validate all user inputs
- Use HTTPS for all communications

### Data Protection

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use secure database connections
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular security audits

## Performance Guidelines

### Database

- Use appropriate indexes
- Optimize query performance
- Implement connection pooling
- Monitor database metrics

### API Design

- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use pagination for large datasets
- Optimize response sizes
- Monitor API performance

### Frontend

- Minimize bundle sizes
- Implement lazy loading
- Optimize images and assets
- Use efficient rendering patterns

## Deployment

### Environment Management

- Use environment-specific configurations
- Implement proper secret management
- Monitor application health
- Implement rollback procedures

### CI/CD Pipeline

- Automated testing on all commits
- Automated deployment to staging
- Manual approval for production
- Automated rollback on failures
- Always deploy from `main` branch

### Monitoring

- Log all significant events
- Monitor system metrics
- Set up alerts for critical issues
- Regular health checks
