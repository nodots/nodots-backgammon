# Deprecated Cursor Rules File

This `.cursorrules` file has been replaced by the consolidated rule system located in the `.cursor/` directory.

**Please refer to the following instead:**

- `.cursor/config.json` for rule configuration
- `.cursor/shared-rules/core-rules.md` for Backgammon domain rules (including the dual pointâ€“numbering system)
- `.cursor/shared-rules/*` for additional shared rules

All sub-packages now receive these shared rules automatically. This file remains only as a pointer for legacy references.
