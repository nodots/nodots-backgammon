# Session Notes - August 18, 2025

## What We Did Today

### Issue Encountered: White Screen of Death (WSOD)
- **Problem**: Application crashed with a white screen, preventing normal usage
- **Root Cause**: TypeScript compilation errors blocking the build process

### Debugging and Fix Attempts
1. **Initial Investigation**
   - Identified build was failing due to TypeScript errors
   - Found multiple type safety issues across several components:
     - `PlayerCards.tsx`: Implicit `any` type errors with array indexing
     - `NodotsDieComponent`: Multiple type mismatches with `BackgammonDieValue` vs `number`
     - `NodotsRollSurfaceComponent`: Invalid props being passed to components

2. **Fix Implementation**
   - Fixed type casting issues in PlayerCards component
   - Updated return types in NodotsDieComponent to properly use `BackgammonDieValue`
   - Removed invalid `rollHandler` props from die components
   - Added proper type imports and assertions

3. **Build Success**
   - All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
   - Build completed successfully with warnings only (Sass deprecations)

### Critical Issue: Application Functionality Broken
- **User Feedback**: After fixes, application was "screwed completely"
- **Response**: Complete revert of all changes made during the session
- **Resolution**: Used `git reset --hard HEAD` to restore original working state

### Key Lessons Learned
1. **TypeScript Strictness**: The codebase has very strict typing that serves as protection against runtime errors
2. **Regression Risk**: Fixing compilation errors without understanding the broader context can break functionality
3. **Testing Required**: Changes need proper testing before being considered complete
4. **User Validation**: Always verify with the user that fixes actually improve the situation

## Current Status
- ✅ Codebase reverted to clean working state (commit: `05083e6`)
- ✅ All modifications removed, including new components and design docs
- ✅ Git working tree clean
- ❌ Original WSOD issue remains unresolved
- ❌ TypeScript compilation errors still present

# Proposed Plan for Tomorrow

## Primary Objective
**Resolve the White Screen of Death without breaking existing functionality**

## Investigation Strategy

### Phase 1: Root Cause Analysis (30 minutes)
1. **Reproduce the WSOD**
   - Document exact steps to trigger the white screen
   - Capture browser console errors and network failures
   - Take screenshots/recordings of the issue

2. **Environment Analysis**
   - Check if dev server starts successfully (`npm run dev`)
   - Verify if the issue is build-related or runtime-related
   - Test if the issue occurs in both dev and production modes

### Phase 2: Minimal Impact Fixes (60 minutes)
1. **Conservative TypeScript Fixes**
   - Fix only the most critical compilation errors that prevent the app from running
   - Use type assertions (`as any`) temporarily rather than structural changes
   - Focus on errors that block webpack/vite compilation

2. **Incremental Testing**
   - Test after each small fix to ensure functionality remains intact
   - Use browser-based verification, not just successful compilation
   - Get user confirmation before proceeding to next fix

### Phase 3: Systematic Verification (30 minutes)
1. **Functional Testing**
   - Test basic navigation (lobby → game creation)
   - Verify game loading and initial board render
   - Test dice rolling and basic interactions

2. **Error Boundary Investigation**
   - Check for React error boundaries that might be catching and hiding errors
   - Look for console warnings that could indicate the problem source

## Backup Strategy
**If TypeScript fixes continue to break functionality:**

1. **Disable TypeScript Checking Temporarily**
   - Modify `tsconfig.json` to be less strict
   - Use `// @ts-ignore` comments strategically
   - Focus on getting the app running first, types second

2. **Alternative Investigation**
   - Look for runtime JavaScript errors unrelated to TypeScript
   - Check for dependency version conflicts
   - Investigate WebSocket connection issues
   - Review recent commits for breaking changes

## Success Criteria for Tomorrow
- [ ] WSOD issue resolved and app loads successfully
- [ ] Basic game functionality verified working
- [ ] No regression in existing features
- [ ] User confirms application is functional
- [ ] TypeScript compilation errors addressed (with minimal impact approach)

## Methodology Changes
1. **Smaller Increments**: Make one small change at a time
2. **Immediate Testing**: Test in browser after each change
3. **User Validation**: Get user approval before proceeding to next fix
4. **Rollback Ready**: Be prepared to quickly revert any change that breaks functionality

## Notes for Next Session
- The CLAUDE.md file contains extensive context about this codebase and common issues
- E2E testing status shows some instability with turn transitions
- The app uses WebSocket connections which could be a source of runtime errors
- Focus on **runtime functionality** over **compile-time perfection**
