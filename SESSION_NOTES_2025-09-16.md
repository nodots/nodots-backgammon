# Session Notes - September 16, 2025

## Primary Issue Reported
**Bar Reentry Bug**: Black robot is stuck on the bar with [1,4] roll when it should be able to move.
- Position 21 is blocked by white (preventing die 4 usage) ‚úì
- Position 24 is open (should allow die 1 usage) ‚ùå BUG
- Robot should use die 1 to reenter at position 24 then pass turn
- **Root Cause Suspected**: Position lookup mismatch in bar reentry logic

## Root Cause Analysis Completed
‚úÖ **Issue #1 (Player Direction) - RULED OUT**
- Verified Black player direction is correctly set to "counterclockwise"
- White player direction is correctly set to "clockwise"
- This is NOT the source of the bug

üéØ **Issue #2 (Position Lookup) - LIKELY ROOT CAUSE**
- Bar reentry calculation: `reentryPoint = 25 - dieValue`
- For Black with die 1: `25 - 1 = 24` (should target counterclockwise position 24)
- Bug likely in `/packages/core/src/Board/index.ts:269`: `p.position[playerDirection] === reentryPoint`
- The position lookup may not be finding the correct board point

## Key Files Identified
- **Core Logic**: `/packages/core/src/Board/index.ts` lines 260-280 (bar reentry logic)
- **Move Selection**: `/packages/ai/src/moveSelection.ts` (robot AI move selection)
- **Position System**: Dual numbering (clockwise vs counterclockwise positions)

## Session Complications (Resolved for Tomorrow)
- Got sidetracked by Auth0 authentication issues preventing E2E testing
- Fixed Auth0 cache location from "localstorage" to "memory" in `/packages/client/src/index.tsx:36`
- API server issues on port 3000 (resolved - server now running)
- E2E test approach was overly complex and not needed

## Next Session Action Plan

### ‚úÖ FOCUS: Direct Core Logic Investigation
1. **Read bar reentry logic** in `/packages/core/src/Board/index.ts:260-280`
2. **Analyze position lookup** - how `p.position[playerDirection] === reentryPoint` works
3. **Verify board point structure** - ensure `position.counterclockwise` values are correct
4. **Test position calculation** - confirm `25 - 1 = 24` maps to correct board point

### üö´ AVOID: E2E Testing Complexity
- Don't get stuck on Auth0, robot list API, or UI testing
- Focus on the core game logic, not the presentation layer
- The bug is in position calculation, not in UI interaction

### üîß Expected Fix Location
- File: `/packages/core/src/Board/index.ts`
- Function: Bar reentry logic around line 269
- Issue: `p.position[playerDirection] === reentryPoint` not finding correct point
- Fix: Verify `playerDirection` and `reentryPoint` calculation match board structure

## Scenario Details
- **Game URL**: http://localhost:5437/game/f263dd9a-d0f9-478d-8233-3d8af15471a7
- **Player**: Black robot (counterclockwise)
- **Dice**: [1,4]
- **Board State**:
  - Position 21 (counterclockwise) = blocked by white checkers
  - Position 24 (counterclockwise) = open for reentry
- **Expected**: Robot uses die 1 to reenter at position 24
- **Actual**: Robot gets stuck, doesn't find the valid move

## Architecture Context
- **Dual Position System**: Each point has `{clockwise: X, counterclockwise: Y}`
- **Bar Reentry Formula**: `25 - dieValue` for counterclockwise players
- **Move Validation**: Must use correct directional perspective for each player

## Key Insight
The individual components (dice rolling, move execution, React handlers) all work correctly. The issue is specifically in the **game state management and position lookup system** during bar reentry for counterclockwise players.

**Tomorrow's Session Goal**: Identify and fix the specific line of code causing the position lookup mismatch in bar reentry logic.
