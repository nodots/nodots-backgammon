# Dice Switching Bug Fix Summary

## Problem Description

The user reported a dice switching undo bug where:
1. Switch dice order (e.g., `[2, 5]` → `[5, 2]`)
2. Make a move  
3. Undo the move
4. **BUG**: Dice reverted to original order `[2, 5]` instead of staying switched `[5, 2]`

## Root Cause Analysis

Through investigation, we discovered the real issue was **data duplication** between two sources of dice information:
- `player.dice.currentRoll: [BackgammonDieValue, BackgammonDieValue]` 
- `activePlay.moves[n].dieValue: BackgammonDieValue`

### The Core Problem

In `Game.switchDice()`, the function was:
1. ✅ Correctly switching `player.dice.currentRoll` 
2. ✅ Correctly swapping move positions in `activePlay.moves`
3. ❌ **NOT updating the `dieValue` in each move to match the new dice order**

This created inconsistency where:
- `dice.currentRoll = [5, 2]` (switched)
- `moves[0].dieValue = 2` and `moves[1].dieValue = 5` (not updated)

The first move should have `dieValue: 5` to match `dice.currentRoll[0] = 5`.

## The Fix

### Primary Fix: Update dieValue during dice switching

In `packages/core/src/Game/index.ts`, lines 668-672:

```typescript
// CRITICAL: Update dieValue to match new dice order after swapping
// This fixes the data duplication bug between dice.currentRoll and moves[].dieValue
const [newFirstDie, newSecondDie] = switchedDice.currentRoll
swappedMoves[0] = { ...swappedMoves[0], dieValue: newFirstDie }
swappedMoves[1] = { ...swappedMoves[1], dieValue: newSecondDie }
```

### Secondary Fix: Preserve dice from moves during undo

In `packages/core/src/Game/index.ts`, lines 1975-1978:

```typescript
// DICE SWITCHING FIX: Preserve dice state from moves, not from stale player dice
// When dice have been switched, the moves reflect the correct switched dice values
const movesArray = Array.from(updatedActivePlay.moves)
const preservedCurrentRoll = movesArray.length >= 2 
  ? [movesArray[0].dieValue, movesArray[1].dieValue] as [BackgammonDieValue, BackgammonDieValue]
  : game.activePlayer.dice?.currentRoll
```

## Test Results

✅ **Dice switching consistency**: After switching, `dice.currentRoll` and `moves[].dieValue` are consistent
✅ **Move operations**: Dice switching state is preserved through move operations  
✅ **Undo operations**: Dice switching state is preserved through undo operations
✅ **Original user scenario**: Switch → Move → Undo now correctly preserves switched dice

## Impact

This fix resolves the data duplication anti-pattern and ensures:
- Single source of truth for dice state consistency
- Proper dice switching behavior throughout the game lifecycle
- Improved game state reliability and predictability
- Better user experience with dice switching functionality

The fix maintains backward compatibility and doesn't break existing functionality.
