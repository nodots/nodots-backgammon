## Branch Migration Summary

### Actions Completed:
1. ✅ **Root Repository**: Switched from `railroad-deploy` → `development`
2. ✅ **Marketing Repository**: Switched from `main` → `development`  
3. ✅ **All Other Repositories**: Already on `development` branch
4. ✅ **Workspace Configuration**: Committed and restored on development branch

### Development Workflow:
- All development work now happens on `development` branches
- Public packages (types, core, ai) can merge development → main for releases
- Private packages (api, client, cli) stay on development for ongoing work
- Workspace root coordinates all package development

## Benefits:
- **Unified Development**: All repos on same branch type for consistency
- **Safe Development**: No accidental changes to main/production branches  
- **Clean Releases**: Public packages can cut releases from development
- **Workspace Sync**: All packages evolve together on development branches

## Next Steps:
1. Continue development work on `development` branches
2. Use `git push origin development` to sync changes
3. Merge to `main` only for stable releases of public packages
4. Root workspace stays on `development` for ongoing integration work
